The data simulates the behavior of Cafe Rewards members over a 30-day period.

Customers receive offers once every few days and have a limited time to redeem them. 

They receive three types of offers:
1. informational offers (simple advertisement of a product), 
2. discount offers, or 
3. BOGO (buy one, get one) offers. 

Each customer receives a different mix of offers, attempting to maximize their probability of making a purchase. Every customer purchase during the period is marked as a transaction. 

# NOTE: A transaction is attributed to an offer ONLY if it occured at the same time as when the offer was "completed" by the customer.

GOAL:
To identify key Cafe Rewards customer segments and develop a data-driven strategy for future promotional messaging & targeting.
