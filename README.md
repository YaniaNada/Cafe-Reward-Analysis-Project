# Cafe-Rewards-Offers_Marketing-Data-Analysis-Project

This repository is for data wrangling of the datasets provided in the "Data" folder for further analysis. 

DATA DESCRIPTION:

Data Structure: Multiple tables
No. Of Records: 306,534
No. Of Fields: 14

Data that simulates the behavior of Cafe Rewards members over a 30-day period, including their transactions and responses to promotional offers.

Customers receive offers once every few days and have a limited time to redeem them. 

These can be informational offers (simple advertisement of a product), discount offers, or "buy one, get one" (BOGO) offers. Each customer receives a different mix of offers, attempting to maximize their probability of making a purchase. Every customer purchase during the period is marked as a transaction. 

# NOTE: For a transaction to be attributed to an offer, it MUST occur at the same time as when the offer was "completed" by the customer.

TASK:
To identify key Cafe Rewards customer segments and develop a data-driven strategy for future promotional messaging & targeting.
